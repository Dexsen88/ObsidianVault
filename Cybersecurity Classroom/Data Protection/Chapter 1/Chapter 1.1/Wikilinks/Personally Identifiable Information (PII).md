### 🧠 **Definition and Sensitivity 🧑‍💻**

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is any data that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific individual, either by itself or when combined with other data.

- **Examples:** Full name, social security number (SSN), driver's license number, home address, date of birth, biometric data, and in some contexts, IP address or precise geolocation.
    
- **Security Impact:** PII is classified as **Confidential/Sensitive** data. Its protection is mandated by strict regulations globally (**[[GDPR]]**, CCPA, HIPAA).
    
- **Control:** Requires strong **[[Confidentiality]]** (via **[[Encryption]]** in transit and at rest) and strict **[[Access Control]]** (**[[Authorization]]**).
