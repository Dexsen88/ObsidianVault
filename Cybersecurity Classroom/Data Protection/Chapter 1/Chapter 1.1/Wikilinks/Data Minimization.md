### 🧠 **Definition and Role 📉**

**Data Minimization** is a core principle of data protection and privacy regulations (like **[[GDPR]]**) stating that organizations should limit the collection, storage, and processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary and relevant for the specified purpose.

- **Goal:** To enhance privacy and reduce the risk exposure associated with collecting sensitive data.
    
- **Security Benefit:** Adhering to this principle reduces the overall attack surface and limits the scope of potential **[[Information Leakage]]** if a breach occurs. If you don't store it, you can't lose it.
    
- **Application:** Includes limiting the types of data collected, ensuring its **[[Session Timeout]]** is short, and securely disposing of it when no longer needed.
