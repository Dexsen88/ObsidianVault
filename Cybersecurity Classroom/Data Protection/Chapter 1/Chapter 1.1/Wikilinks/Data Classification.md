### 🧠 **Definition and Purpose 🏷️**

**Data Classification** is the process of categorizing an organization's information based on its sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements.

- **Goal:** To ensure that the security controls applied to data are commensurate with the level of risk. Highly sensitive data receives the strongest controls, while public data receives minimal controls.
    
- **Impact:** Proper classification is the foundation for defining policies on access control (**[[Authorization]]**), **[[Encryption]]**, retention, and disposal.
    
- **Levels:** Typically ranges from Public to Internal/Private to Confidential/Sensitive (which includes **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]**).
