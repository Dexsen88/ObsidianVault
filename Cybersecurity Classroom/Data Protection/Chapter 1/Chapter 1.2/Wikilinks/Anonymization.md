### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🕶️**

**Anonymization** is a **Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET)** where identifying fields and **quasi-identifiers** are altered, generalized, or removed to the point where the data subject can no longer be identified, even by combining the data with external sources.

- **Goal:** To achieve the highest level of privacy protection by ensuring that re-identification is _irreversible_ and computationally infeasible.
    
- **Regulatory Impact:** Once data is properly anonymized, it generally falls outside the regulatory scope of laws like **[[GDPR]]** and is no longer classified as **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]**.
    
- **Trade-off:** Often results in a loss of data fidelity and analytical utility compared to **[[Pseudonymization]]**.
