### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 📝**

**Pseudonymization** is a **Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET)** where the direct identifiers of a data subject (e.g., name, address) are replaced with an artificial identifier (a pseudonym). The link between the pseudonym and the real identity is kept separate and highly secured.

- **Goal:** To protect **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]** while maintaining the data's analytical utility.
    
- **Key Feature:** The process is **reversible** because the original identity can be retrieved by looking up the pseudonym in the secure, isolated key or mapping table.
    
- **Regulatory Impact:** Under **[[GDPR]]**, pseudonymized data is still considered PII because the identity can be recovered. It requires continued protection, but it is viewed more favorably than raw, non-obfuscated data.
