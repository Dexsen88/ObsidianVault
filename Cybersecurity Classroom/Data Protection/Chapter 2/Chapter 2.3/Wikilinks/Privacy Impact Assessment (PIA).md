### 🧠 **Definition and Process 📋**

A **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** (or **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** under **[[GDPR]]**) is a formal, pre-emptive process used to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks and negative effects that a new project, system, or process may have on individual privacy.

- **Goal:** To embed **[[Data Protection]]** principles ("Privacy by Design") early in the development lifecycle, ensuring compliance with **[[Data Minimization]]** and other regulatory requirements before sensitive data is processed.
    
- **Procedure:** Involves documenting the data flows, identifying all **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]** touched by the system, assessing the likelihood and severity of risks, and defining specific security controls to mitigate those risks.
    
- **Mandate:** It is mandatory under several privacy laws for high-risk data processing activities.
