### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 💥**

**Data Sanitization** is the irreversible process of completely destroying or rendering data unrecoverable from a storage medium. It is the mandatory method of disposing of sensitive **[[Data at Rest]]** when it is no longer needed.

- **Goal:** To ensure that data recovery, even with advanced forensic tools, is impossible, thereby guaranteeing **[[Confidentiality]]** after disposal.
    
- **Methods:** Techniques include **Purging** (software or hardware overwrite), **Degaussing** (for magnetic media), and **Physical Destruction** (shredding or melting the device).
    
- **Requirement:** Simply deleting files or reformatting a drive is **not** a secure sanitization method, as the underlying data often remains intact and recoverable.
