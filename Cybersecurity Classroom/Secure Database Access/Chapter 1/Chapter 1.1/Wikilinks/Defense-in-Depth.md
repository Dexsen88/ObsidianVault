### 🧠 **Definition and Principle 🛡️**

**Defense-in-Depth** is a security strategy that applies multiple layers of security controls, so that if one control fails or is bypassed, a subsequent layer of defense is in place to protect the asset.

- **Goal:** To create a non-single point of failure security model. It forces an attacker to defeat numerous controls, significantly increasing the cost and complexity of a successful attack.
    
- **Database Context:** This means protecting the database using network firewalls, OS hardening, strong user privileges, and finally, data **[[Encryption]]**.
    
- **Contrast:** The opposite approach is "security by obscurity," which relies on a single, secret control.
