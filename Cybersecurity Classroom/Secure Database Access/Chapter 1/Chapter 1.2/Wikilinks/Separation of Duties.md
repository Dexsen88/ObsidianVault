### 🧠 **Definition and Purpose ⚖️**

**Separation of Duties** (SoD) is a mandatory administrative control that ensures that no single individual or entity has unilateral control over two or more phases of a critical process.

- **Goal:** To prevent conflicts of interest, internal fraud, abuse of privilege, and errors by requiring collusion to complete a malicious action. This strengthens **[[Integrity]]** and **[[Non-Repudiation]]**.
    
- **Database Example:** The person who can _create_ a user account should not be the person who can _approve_ a high-value transaction initiated by that account.
    
- **Mandate:** Critical security and financial processes must be broken down into steps that require multiple, distinct roles to complete.
