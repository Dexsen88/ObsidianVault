### 🧠 **Pillar of the CIA Triad 🟢**

**Availability** is the principle that ensures authorized users can access the information and systems they need when they need them. It is the "A" in the foundational **[[CIA Triad]]** security model.

- **Goal:** To guarantee reliable and timely access to systems and data. Systems must be fault-tolerant and have sufficient resources and capacity to handle expected and unexpected loads.
    
- **Controls:** Availability is maintained through technical measures like redundancy, backup systems, failover clusters, and robust protection against **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]** attacks.
    
- **Violation:** The principle is violated when systems crash, services are disabled, or access is slowed to an unusable state, often as a result of an attack or a simple unhandled **[[Error and Exception Handling]]** failure that crashes the application.
