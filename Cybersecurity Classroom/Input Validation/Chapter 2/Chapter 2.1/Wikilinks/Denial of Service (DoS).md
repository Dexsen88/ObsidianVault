### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 💥**

**Denial of Service (DoS)** is an attack that attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. This is accomplished by overwhelming the target system with a flood of traffic or resource-consuming requests, causing it to crash or operate so slowly that it becomes unusable.

- **Goal:** To violate the **[[Availability]]** pillar of the security triad.
    
- **Input Validation Defense:** By strictly limiting the maximum length of string inputs and array sizes, developers prevent attackers from sending requests so large they exhaust the application's memory or CPU resources. This is a crucial, preventative measure.
    
- **Types:** A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack uses multiple compromised computer systems to launch the attack, making it harder to block.
