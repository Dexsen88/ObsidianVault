✅ **Correct Answer: C) [[Availability]] and [[Information Leakage]].**

💡 **Explanation:** The crash violates **[[Availability]]** (the system stops working). Displaying the technical details (file paths, etc.) constitutes **[[Information Leakage]]**, which violates **[[Confidentiality]]** by giving the attacker critical information for a follow-up attack.
