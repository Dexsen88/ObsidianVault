✅ **Correct Answer: B) Attackers can bypass the filter by using different encoding schemes (e.g., URL encoding, HTML entities) for malicious characters.**

💡 **Explanation:** Blacklisting is inherently brittle. Attackers can always find a new way to represent a malicious character (encoding) that isn't on the block list, making it ineffective.
