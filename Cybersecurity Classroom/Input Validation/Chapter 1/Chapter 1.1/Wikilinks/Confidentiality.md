### 🧠 **Pillar of the CIA Triad 🤫**

**Confidentiality** is the principle of preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information. It is the "C" in the foundational **[[CIA Triad]]** of information security.

- **Goal:** To ensure that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to access it and is hidden from everyone else.
    
- **Controls:** Confidentiality is enforced through measures like:
    
    - **[[Access Control]]** (permissions and authorization).
        
    - **[[Encryption]]** (data at rest and in transit).
        
    - Effective **[[Input Validation]]** (to prevent **[[SQL Injection]]** or **[[XSS]]** that could steal data).
        
- **Violation:** The principle is violated when sensitive data, like passwords, personally identifiable information (PII), or trade secrets, is viewed by an unauthorized party.
