### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🗝️**

**Access Control** is a security mechanism that determines **who** (a user or process) is allowed to perform **what** actions (read, write, execute) on **which** resources (files, functions, databases).

- **Goal:** To enforce **[[Confidentiality]]** and **[[Integrity]]** by ensuring users only interact with data and functionality for which they have explicit authorization.
    
- **Core Concepts:**
    
    - **Authentication:** Verifying the user's identity (e.g., username and password).
        
    - **Authorization:** Granting specific permissions based on the verified identity.
        
- **Types of Models:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
