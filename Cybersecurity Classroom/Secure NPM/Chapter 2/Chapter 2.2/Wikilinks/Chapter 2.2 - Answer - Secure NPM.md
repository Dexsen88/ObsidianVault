✅ **Correct Answer: B) Running `npm install` with the `--ignore-scripts` flag, and running the install process using a dedicated, low-privilege service account.**

💡 **Explanation:** Ignoring scripts prevents the malicious code from running, and the low-privilege account limits the damage if the script _does_ execute, enforcing **[[Principle of Least Privilege]]**.
