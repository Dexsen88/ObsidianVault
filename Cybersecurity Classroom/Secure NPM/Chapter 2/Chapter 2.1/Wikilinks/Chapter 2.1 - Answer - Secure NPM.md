✅ **Correct Answer: B) Store the token in a [[Key Management System (KMS)]] and configure it with short expiry and only the publish privilege (Principle of Least Privilege).**

💡 **Explanation:** The **KMS** provides secure storage (protecting **[[Confidentiality]]**), and limiting its privileges to only _publish_ (not _admin_) enforces the **[[Principle of Least Privilege]]**, minimizing the impact of a breach.
