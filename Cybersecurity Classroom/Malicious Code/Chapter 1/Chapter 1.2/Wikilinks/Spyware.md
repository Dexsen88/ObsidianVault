### 🧠 **Definition and Purpose 👁️‍🗨️**

**Spyware** is a type of **[[Malware]]** that secretly observes the user's activities on a computer system, gathers information about them and their organization, and transmits the collected data to an attacker.

- **Goal:** To steal **[[Confidentiality]]**-protected data (credentials, financial information, trade secrets) and facilitate **[[Information Leakage]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** It operates without the user's knowledge, often bundling components like **[[Keylogger]]**s and screen-capturing tools.
    
- **Defense:** Relies heavily on anti-malware software that performs heuristic analysis (behavior detection) rather than just signature matching, since **[[Spyware]]** often changes frequently.
