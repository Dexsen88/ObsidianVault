### 🧠 **Definition and Function 👻**

A **Rootkit** is a collection of software tools designed to obtain and maintain **root-level access** (highest privileges) to a computer system while actively hiding its presence and the presence of other **[[Malware]]** from detection by system administrators and security tools.

- **Goal:** To achieve persistence and stealth, often by altering the operating system kernel or core system files to intercept and manipulate calls related to file listings or process information.
    
- **Impact:** A device infected with a **[[Rootkit]]** cannot be trusted, as the rootkit controls the security functions designed to detect it.
    
- **Defense:** Detection often requires specialized, out-of-band tools or comparing a system's memory or disk contents against a trusted baseline.
