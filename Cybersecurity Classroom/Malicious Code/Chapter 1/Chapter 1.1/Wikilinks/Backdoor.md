### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🚪**

A **Backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal **[[Authentication]]** and **[[Authorization]]** procedures in a system, application, or network device.

- **Goal:** To gain remote, persistent, and often undetectable access to a compromised system after the initial infection (often delivered via a **[[Trojan Horse]]**). This violates **[[Confidentiality]]** and **[[Integrity]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** It can be implanted during development, hidden within **[[Malware]]**, or created by exploiting a vulnerability. Once active, it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands (**[[Command Injection]]** style).
    
- **Defense:** Regular code audits, network monitoring for unusual outbound connections, and strict vulnerability management.
