### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🎣**

**Phishing** is a social engineering technique where an attacker attempts to trick a user into revealing sensitive information (like credentials or **[[Session Token]]**s) or into clicking a malicious link/attachment.

- **Goal:** To gain unauthorized **[[Authentication]]** (access) to systems or to deliver a **[[Malware]]** payload (like a **[[Trojan Horse]]** or **[[Ransomware]]**).
    
- **Mechanism:** Attackers typically disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity (e.g., a bank, a colleague, or a cloud service provider) in an electronic communication (email, text, or phone call).
    
- **Defense:** User education, multi-factor **[[Authentication]]**, and strong email filtering.
