### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🐎**

A **Trojan Horse** is a type of **[[Malware]]** that is maliciously disguised as legitimate, desirable, or routine software. The user willingly installs or executes the program, believing it is benign.

- **Goal:** To gain initial access to a system to install a secondary payload, such as a **[[Backdoor]]**, **[[Keylogger]]**, or **[[Ransomware]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** Relies entirely on social engineering (**[[Phishing]]**) to trick the user into executing the program.
    
- **Key Feature:** Unlike a **[[Virus]]**, it does not infect other files, and unlike a **[[Worm]]**, it does not self-replicate across the network.
