### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🐛**

A **Worm** is a type of self-replicating **[[Malware]]** that does not require a host file or user intervention to spread.

- **Goal:** To consume network bandwidth, system resources, or crash entire networks, leading to a **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** It actively scans the network for vulnerable machines (e.g., those missing a patch) and installs itself on them to continue propagation.
    
- **Key Feature:** Its self-propagating nature makes it extremely efficient at infecting large numbers of systems very quickly.
