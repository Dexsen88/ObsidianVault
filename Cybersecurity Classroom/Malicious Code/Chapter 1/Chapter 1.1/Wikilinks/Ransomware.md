### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 💰**

**Ransomware** is a type of **[[Malware]]**, often delivered via a **[[Trojan Horse]]**, that encrypts the victim's files or entire operating system, making them inaccessible. The attacker then demands a **ransom** payment (typically in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key.

- **Goal:** Financial extortion.
    
- **Impact:** Directly violates the **[[Availability]]** and **[[Confidentiality]]** of the system and data.
    
- **Defense:** A strong **[[Data Protection]]** strategy that includes segregated, offsite backups and a comprehensive recovery plan is the only reliable way to recover without paying the ransom.
