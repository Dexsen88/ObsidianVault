### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism ⌨️**

A **Keylogger** is a type of **[[Malware]]** or physical device specifically designed to record every keystroke made by a user on a target machine.

- **Goal:** To steal sensitive information entered via the keyboard, most critically usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]**. This is a direct attack on **[[Confidentiality]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** It operates invisibly in the background, capturing input events before they are encrypted or processed, and periodically sending the captured data back to the attacker.
    
- **Defense:** Strong anti-malware software, virtual keyboards (to bypass physical input), and network monitoring for outbound traffic to suspicious command-and-control servers.
