### 🧠 **Definition and Process 🚨**

**Vulnerability Management** is the continuous, cyclical process of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating software and system weaknesses.

- **Goal:** To reduce the organization's exposure to threats by quickly fixing **[[Vulnerability]]**s before they can be exploited by **[[Malware]]** or external attackers.
    
- **Key Activities:** Regular scanning of all systems, assessing the risk (severity $\times$ ease of exploit), prioritizing the application of **Security Patch**es, and documenting the fixes.
    
- **Importance:** It is the core process that ensures timely patching, thereby mitigating the risk of **N-Day** exploits.
