This quiz contains five questions covering all material from Chapters 1.1 through 2.3.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 1 (Malware Types)**

**Q:** An attacker delivers a malicious attachment via a **[[Phishing]]** email. The file, disguised as an invoice, is executed by the user and immediately begins encrypting all system files, demanding a ransom. What two types of **[[Malware]]** are most accurately described by this attack chain?

A) **[[Worm]]** and **[[Rootkit]]**.

B) **[[Keylogger]]** and **[[Backdoor]]**.

C) **[[Trojan Horse]]** and **[[Ransomware]]**. 

D) **[[Virus]]** and **[[Vulnerability]]**.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 2 (Defense Against Entry)**

**Q:** Which defense strategy addresses the most critical technical entry point for **[[Malware]]** by eliminating the weakness that an **Exploit** targets?

A) Implementing strict **[[Rate Limiting]]** on all network interfaces.

B) Enforcing **[[Contextual Output Encoding]]** across the application front-end.

C) Applying all **Security Patch**es promptly as part of a **[[Vulnerability Management]]** program. 

D) Using **[[Parameterization]]** for all database queries.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 3 (Post-Exploitation Stages)**

**Q:** An attacker compromises a low-privilege web server, then exploits a system misconfiguration to gain root access. After that, they use their new root credentials to authenticate to and dump a database on a separate server. What are the two attack stages that occurred _after_ the initial compromise?

A) **[[Command-and-Control (C2)]]** followed by **[[Phishing]]**.

B) **[[Lateral Movement]]** followed by **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]**.

C) **[[Privilege Escalation]]** followed by **[[Lateral Movement]]**. 

D) **[[Keylogger]]** deployment followed by **[[SQL Injection]]**.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 4 (The Purpose of Concealment)**

**Q:** Why is a **[[Rootkit]]** often considered the most dangerous piece of **[[Malware]]** to have on a system, even if it performs no direct malicious action itself?

A) Because it causes a direct **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]** attack by exhausting CPU.

B) **Because it allows other malware (like a [[Backdoor]] or [[Keylogger]]) to remain persistently hidden from OS-level security and monitoring tools.** 

C) Because it automatically sends out **[[Phishing]]** emails to every user contact.

D) Because it is used exclusively to encrypt files for **[[Ransomware]]** attacks.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 5 (Defense Against Data Exfiltration)**

**Q:** An employee's workstation is infected with a **[[Keylogger]]** via a **[[Phishing]]** attack. The attacker is successfully receiving stolen data via a hidden network channel. What security control should be implemented or enhanced to detect and stop this stage of the attack?

A) Implementing **[[Timeout]]** on local disk reads.

B) **Network behavioral analysis and monitoring to detect unusual, covert outbound traffic destined for a [[Command-and-Control (C2)]] server.** 

C) Enforcing **[[Custom Exceptions]]** for all application errors.

D) Using a simple **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]** attack against the workstation.
