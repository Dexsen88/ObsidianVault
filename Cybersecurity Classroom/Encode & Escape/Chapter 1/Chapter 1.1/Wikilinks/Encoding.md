### 🧠 **Definition and Purpose 📝**

**Encoding** is the process of transforming data into a format that can be reliably transmitted or stored across different systems or protocols (e.g., URL encoding, Base64 encoding).

- **Goal:** To ensure data integrity and reliable transmission by representing all characters in a common, safe format. It is used to overcome protocol limitations (e.g., reserved characters in URLs).
    
- **Mechanism:** It is a **two-way** process—the data can be easily decoded back to its original form.
    
- **Security Note:** Encoding is primarily about representation, **not** security. It does not prevent injection attacks on its own; that requires **[[Escaping]]**.
