✅ **Correct Answer: B) Validation must be performed on the server ([[Server-Side Validation]]) because client-side logic can be bypassed by an attacker sending arbitrary data across the [[Trust Boundary]].**

💡 **Explanation:** Since the client is outside the server's **[[Trust Boundary]]** and is fully controlled by the user, **[[Server-Side Validation]]** is the only reliable way to ensure that malicious data does not enter the application.
