✅ **Correct Answer: C) Because it separates the structure of the SQL command from the user-supplied data, ensuring the database treats the input as literal data and never as executable code.**

💡 **Explanation:** The database interprets parameterized data literally, which means characters like `'` or `--` lose their special SQL meaning. This is a structural fix that is impossible to bypass.
