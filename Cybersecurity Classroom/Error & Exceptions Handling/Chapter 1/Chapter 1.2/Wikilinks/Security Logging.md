### 🧠 **Definition and Protection 🔐**

**Security Logging** is the mandatory process of creating, storing, and protecting detailed records (**Audit Logs**) of all security-relevant activities and errors within a system.

- **Goal:** To provide an irrefutable, **tamper-proof audit trail** for monitoring, alerting on attacks, and performing forensic analysis after a security incident.
    
- **What to Record:** Successful and failed **[[Authentication]]**, **[[Authorization]]** attempts, configuration changes, and access to sensitive data (like **[[Personally Identifiable Information (PII)]]** or **[[Private Key]]**s).
    
- **Mandate:** Logs must be protected from modification using strong **[[Integrity]]** controls (e.g., write-once storage, **[[Cryptographic Hash]]**ing), and **must never** contain sensitive secrets (**[[Data Protection]]**).
