Aisha encountered a database connection error on her production website. The resulting error page displayed the full database username, password, connection string, and the exact line of code that failed.

Elena: “That’s a catastrophic **[[Information Leakage]]**! You violated two core security principles: **[[Fail-Safe Defaults]]** and the prevention of **Verbose Errors**. An attacker learned everything they need for a deeper attack, just from a single failure.”

### 🧠 **Fail-Safe Defaults (Fail Securely)**

The principle of **[[Fail-Safe Defaults]]** (also known as Fail Securely) dictates that when a system component fails or encounters an unexpected condition, it should revert to a state that denies access or prevents compromise, rather than continuing operation in an insecure manner.

- **Goal:** To preserve **[[Confidentiality]]** and **[[Integrity]]** during a fault condition.
    
- **Example:** If an application cannot contact the **[[Authorization]]** service, the secure action is to deny the user access (fail securely), not to assume the user is authorized (fail open).
    

### 💡 **Verbose Errors and Information Leakage**

A **[[Verbose Error Message]]** is a detailed error generated by a system that exposes internal information about the environment, architecture, or source code.

- **Vulnerability:** This exposes secrets like database credentials, file paths, library versions, or internal logic, which is classified as **[[Information Leakage]]**.
    
- **Attack:** An attacker often intentionally triggers errors (e.g., using a malformed query) to "fish" for a **[[Verbose Error Message]]** that can guide an **[[SQL Injection]]** or **[[Command Injection]]** attack.
    
- **Mandatory Control:** Applications must catch system-level exceptions and present only generic, user-friendly messages (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."), while logging the full details internally.
    

### 🎯 **Handling Uncaught Exceptions**
![[Handling Uncuahgt Exceptions.png]]

All modern security frameworks mandate a global, application-wide **Exception Handler** to catch any errors that are missed by local `try-catch` blocks. This ensures that a **[[Verbose Error Message]]** is never returned to the user, even in the event of a catastrophic failure. This handler enforces the **[[Fail-Safe Defaults]]** principle at the application level.

### 🧩 **Mini Quiz – Chapter 1.1**

**Q:** When a system loses connection to the **[[Authorization]]** server, it defaults to granting all users full access, resulting in a **[[Confidentiality]]** breach. Which security principle was violated, and what should the system have done instead?

A) Principle Violated: **[[Data Minimization]]**; Should have used **[[Tokenization]]**.

B) **Principle Violated: [[Fail-Safe Defaults]]; Should have denied all access until the authorization service was restored.** 

C) Principle Violated: **[[Contextual Output Encoding]]**; Should have used **[[Parameterization]]**.

D) Principle Violated: **[[Non-Repudiation]]**; Should have used a **[[Digital Signature]]**.

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives – Chapter 1.1**

By the end of this sub-chapter, you should be able to:

- Define **[[Fail-Safe Defaults]]** and justify why a secure application must "fail closed."
    
- Explain how **[[Verbose Error Message]]**s lead to **[[Information Leakage]]**.
    
- Identify the mandatory defense: never display system-level errors to the end-user.
