### 🧠 **Definition and Purpose 🌐**

The **TLS Protocol** (Transport Layer Security), formerly known as SSL, is the cryptographic protocol that secures communication over a computer network. It is the security layer behind HTTPS.

- **Goal:** To provide **[[Confidentiality]]**, **[[Integrity]]**, and **Authenticity** for **Data in Transit** (data moving between a client and a server).
    
- **Mechanism:** It uses a **Handshake** to establish a secure connection using a **[[Hybrid Cryptosystem]]** where **[[Asymmetric Encryption]]** is used to exchange a fast, per-session **[[Symmetric Key]]**.
    
- **Mandatory Control:** It is the mandatory security control for all web, email, and network communications where data secrecy and authenticity are required.
