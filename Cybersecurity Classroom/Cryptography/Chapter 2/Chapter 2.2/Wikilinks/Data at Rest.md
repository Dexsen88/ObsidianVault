### 🧠 **Definition and Protection 💾**

**Data at Rest** refers to data that is stored on any physical medium (hard drives, solid-state drives, backup tapes, storage arrays, etc.) and is not currently moving across a network.

- **Goal:** To protect the **[[Confidentiality]]** of the data even if the physical storage medium is compromised (stolen laptop, breached server).
    
- **Standard Control:** Strong, usually **[[Symmetric Encryption]]** (e.g., AES-256), applied at the file, volume (full-disk encryption), or database level.
    
- **Vulnerability:** The security relies entirely on the strength and secrecy of the encryption key, which introduces the **[[Key Management]]** problem.
