### 🧠 **Definition and Role 🤫**

The **Private Key** is the second half of the key pair used in **[[Asymmetric Encryption]]**. It is the most sensitive secret and must be guarded securely by its owner.

- **Role in Decryption:** The **Private Key** is the only key capable of decrypting data that was encrypted with the matching **[[Public Key]]**.
    
- **Role in Signatures:** The **Private Key** is used by the owner to create a **[[Digital Signature]]**, which proves the sender's identity.
    
- **Security:** If a **Private Key** is stolen or compromised, the attacker can decrypt all incoming communications and forge **[[Digital Signature]]**s from the owner, leading to a complete failure of **[[Confidentiality]]** and non-repudiation.
