✅ **Correct Answer: B) [[Symmetric Encryption]] because it is significantly faster and more efficient for encrypting bulk data.**

💡 **Explanation:** **[[Symmetric Encryption]]** is the industry standard for encrypting large amounts of **Data at Rest** due to its speed and low computational overhead compared to **[[Asymmetric Encryption]]**. Key exchange is not an issue when encrypting data stored locally.
