### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🔑🔑**

**Asymmetric Encryption** (or public-key cryptography) is an encryption method that uses a pair of mathematically linked keys: a **[[Public Key]]** and a **[[Private Key]]**.

- **Goal:** To provide **[[Confidentiality]]** without requiring a prior secure channel for key exchange. It is also used to enable **[[Digital Signature]]**s.
    
- **Mechanism:** Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the matching private key.
    
- **Standard:** Common algorithms include **RSA** and **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**. Its slower performance makes it impractical for encrypting large amounts of bulk data.
