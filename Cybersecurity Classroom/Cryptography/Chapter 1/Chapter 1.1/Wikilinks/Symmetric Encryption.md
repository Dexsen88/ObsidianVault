### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🔑**

**Symmetric Encryption** (or secret-key cryptography) is an encryption method that uses the **same, single secret key** for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of the resulting ciphertext.

- **Goal:** To provide **[[Confidentiality]]** of data at high speed and efficiency.
    
- **Standard:** The most widely used algorithm is **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**.
    
- **Core Challenge:** The secure exchange of the secret key between the communicating parties is mandatory before any encrypted communication can begin (the key exchange problem). This is a primary factor in choosing a **[[Hybrid Cryptosystem]]** for communications.
