✅ **Correct Answer: C) Primitive: [[Cryptographic Hash]] (e.g., SHA-256); Property: Collision Resistance.**

💡 **Explanation:** **[[Cryptographic Hash]]**es are used for **[[Integrity]]** checks. The **Collision Resistance** property ensures it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to modify the file (input) without changing the hash (output), making the verification process reliable.
