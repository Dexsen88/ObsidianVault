✅ **Correct Answer: D) A [[Hardware Security Module (HSM)]] is used to store the key in tamper-proof hardware, enforcing key access control.**

💡 **Explanation:** The **[[Hardware Security Module (HSM)]]** is the industry standard for high-security storage of master keys. It performs cryptographic operations internally, ensuring the key never leaves the secure hardware boundary, which is the ultimate solution to the **[[Key Management]]** problem.
