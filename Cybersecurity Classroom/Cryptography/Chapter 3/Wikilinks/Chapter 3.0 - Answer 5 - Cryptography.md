✅ **Correct Answer: C) To prevent mass, pre-computed [[Rainbow Table]] attacks by ensuring identical passwords result in unique hashes.**

💡 **Explanation:** The **[[Salt]]**'s primary purpose is to introduce sufficient randomness to defeat pre-computed **[[Rainbow Table]]**s. It forces an attacker to crack each password individually, even if they use a fast-cracking method on the slower **[[Key Derivation Function (KDF)]]**.
