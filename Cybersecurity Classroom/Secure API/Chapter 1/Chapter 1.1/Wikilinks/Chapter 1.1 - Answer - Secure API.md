✅ **Correct Answer: B) Because a JWT is digitally signed, allowing the API to quickly verify its integrity and non-repudiation without requiring a database lookup for every request.**

💡 **Explanation:** The **[[Digital Signature]]** on a JWT ensures **[[Integrity]]** and **[[Non-Repudiation]]**, making the API stateless and highly scalable, which is critical for modern application architecture.
