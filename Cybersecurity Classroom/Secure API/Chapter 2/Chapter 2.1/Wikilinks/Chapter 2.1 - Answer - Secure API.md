✅ **Correct Answer: B) Vulnerability: [[Mass Assignment]]; Defense: Strictly allow-list (whitelist) all updatable fields on the server-side.**

💡 **Explanation:** **[[Mass Assignment]]** occurs when the server blindly binds all request parameters to the object. An **Allow-List** policy ensures only explicitly permitted fields are updated.
