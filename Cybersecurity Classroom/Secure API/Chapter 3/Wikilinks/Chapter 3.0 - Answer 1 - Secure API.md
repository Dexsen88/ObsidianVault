✅ **Correct Answer: C) Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR).**

💡 **Explanation:** The vulnerability is the failure to perform an **[[Authorization]]** check on the **Direct Object Reference** (`ID-555`), allowing the authenticated user (User A) to access data they don't own, which is the definition of **[[BOLA]]** / **[[IDOR]]**.
