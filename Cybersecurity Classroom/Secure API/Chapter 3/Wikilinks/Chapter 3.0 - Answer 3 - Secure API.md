✅ **Correct Answer: C) Using an Allow-List (Whitelist) to explicitly specify and enforce only the fields (e.g., 'name', 'email') the client is permitted to update.**

💡 **Explanation:** The **Allow-List** approach is the only structural defense against **[[Mass Assignment]]** because it guarantees that unauthorized fields are dropped before they are bound to the internal data model, protecting data **[[Integrity]]**.
