This quiz contains five questions covering all material from Chapters 1.1 through 2.3.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 1 (Log Immutability)**

**Q:** What two mandatory security principles are directly supported by configuring a centralized **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]** system to be Write-Once, Read-Many (**WORM**) and restricting log deletion permissions?

A) **[[Data Encryption]]** and **[[Buffer Overflow]]** defense.

B) **[[Non-Repudiation]]** and **[[Integrity]]** of the forensic evidence. 

C) **[[Data Minimization]]** and **[[Verbose Error Message]]** suppression.

D) **[[Parameterization]]** and **[[Lateral Movement]]** detection.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 2 (Log Content Mandate)**

**Q:** Why is the logging of sensitive data, such as plaintext passwords or full session tokens, a catastrophic security failure, and which principle is violated?

A) Because it compromises **[[Non-Repudiation]]**; Principle Violated: **[[Lateral Movement]]**.

B) Because it slows down **[[Incident Response]]**; Principle Violated: **[[Availability]]**.

C) **Because it exposes high-value secrets in a log file, transforming the log system itself into a target for [[Information Leakage]]; Principle Violated: [[Data Minimization]].** 

D) Because it causes a **[[Buffer Overflow]]**; Principle Violated: **[[Integrity]]**.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 3 (Threat Detection)**

**Q:** Which type of **high-fidelity alerting rule** is mandatory in a **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]** system to detect an attacker attempting **[[Lateral Movement]]** or a sophisticated breach?

A) An alert for every single successful application login.

B) An alert whenever a **[[Verbose Error Message]]** is logged.

C) **An alert generated by the correlation of multiple events, such as a failed login attempt on Server A immediately followed by a successful privileged database connection on Server B.** 

D) An alert whenever a package is flagged by **[[Software Composition Analysis (SCA)]]**.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 4 (Incident Response)**

**Q:** In the **Incident Response** life cycle, what critical step relies on the precise, synchronized log data to stop an ongoing attack, and what is the primary goal of this step?

A) Step: Preparation; Goal: Defining the **[[Log Retention]]** policy.

B) **Step: Containment; Goal: To stop the immediate damage by isolating the attacker, such as by disabling the compromised account.** 

C) Step: Forensics; Goal: Generating a **[[Cryptographic Hash]]** of the root cause.

D) Step: Recovery; Goal: Running a **[[Software Composition Analysis (SCA)]]** report.

### 🧩 **Quiz Question 5 (Compliance and Forensics)**

**Q:** Why is **time synchronization** (using UTC/GMT) mandatory for all log-generating systems (firewalls, applications, databases) in a production environment?

A) To prevent **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]** attacks on the network.

B) To strictly enforce the **[[Principle of Least Privilege]]** for log-in users.

C) **To ensure that during a forensic investigation, log entries from multiple, disparate systems can be accurately correlated and sequenced to build a reliable chain of events.** 

D) To facilitate **[[Data Masking]]** of timestamps in the **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]**.
