### 🧠 **Definition and Role 🧠**

A **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system is a centralized platform designed to aggregate, correlate, and analyze security data from various sources (applications, firewalls, servers, databases) across an organization's IT infrastructure.

- **Goal:** To provide a unified, real-time view of the security posture, **detect attack patterns** that span multiple systems (**Threat Correlation**), and provide automated alerts when suspicious activity is identified.
    
- **Mechanism:** The **SIEM** acts as the secured, **write-once, read-many (WORM)** centralized repository for all **[[Security Logging]]** data, where it enforces the principles of **Immutability** and performs near real-time analysis for anomalies.
    
- **Mandate:** Critical for compliance, minimizing **Dwell Time**, and achieving true **Threat Intelligence** by moving beyond raw log file analysis.
