✅ **Correct Answer: C) To prevent a recently stolen or compromised [[Session Token]] from remaining valid, minimizing the risk of [[Session Hijacking]] under the old security context.**

💡 **Explanation:** A password change signals a critical security event. **[[Session Revocation]]** forces the user to log in again with the new password, immediately invalidating any old token that an attacker might have acquired before or during the password change.
