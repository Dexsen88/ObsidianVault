🌟 **Aisha’s Login Challenge** 
![[Aisha's Login Challenge.png]]
Aisha designed a login screen that only required a username and password. She felt that was secure enough, but Elena pointed to a recent security alert: a single compromised password could grant an attacker full access to the user's account.

Elena: “Authentication isn't just about one secret; it's about proving identity with multiple, independent factors. Relying only on a password violates the **[[Defense in Depth]]** principle and exposes you to single-factor compromise.”

### 🧠 **The Three Factors of Authentication (3FA)**

**Authentication** is the process of verifying a claimed identity. A strong authentication scheme validates a user based on at least one (and ideally two or more) of the three fundamental authentication factors:

1. **Something You Know (Knowledge Factor):** A secret piece of information that only the user should know.
    
    - _Examples:_ Password, PIN, a secret answer.
        
    - _Vulnerability:_ Easily phished, guessed, or stolen from a server breach (**[[Information Leakage]]**).
        
2. **Something You Have (Possession Factor):** A physical item the user possesses and controls.
    
    - _Examples:_ A **[[Hardware Token]]** (like a Yubikey), a smart card, or a temporary code generated by a mobile authenticator app.
        
    - _Vulnerability:_ Can be lost or stolen.
        
3. **Something You Are (Inherence Factor):** A physical, unique trait of the user's body.
    
    - _Examples:_ Fingerprint, facial scan, voice print, or retina scan.
        
    - _Vulnerability:_ Biometric data can be spoofed or can't be changed if compromised.
        

### 💡 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

![[MFA.png]]

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is the practice of requiring a user to successfully present evidence from **two or more** of these independent factors. For instance, a password (Knowledge) combined with a code from an authenticator app (Possession).

- **Goal:** To mitigate the risk of a single factor being compromised. If a hacker steals your password (Factor 1), they still cannot log in without your phone (Factor 2).
    
- **Best Practice:** MFA is mandatory for all high-value accounts and enforces the **[[Confidentiality]]** of sensitive user data.
    

### 🎯 **The Weak Link: Password Storage**

Even the strongest password is useless if it's stored insecurely. The application must **NEVER** store plain-text passwords. Instead, it must store a **[[Password Hash]]**—a one-way cryptographic representation of the password.

- This process uses a specialized algorithm (like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt) and a unique random value called a **[[Salt]]** to make the resulting hash unique, even if two users choose the same password. If a breach occurs, the passwords are not recoverable.

### 🧩 **Mini Quiz – Chapter 1.1**

**Q:** A secure application requires a user to enter their password and a one-time code sent to their registered email address. This combination is an example of what, based on the three factors of authentication?

A) Two instances of the Knowledge Factor.

B) **The Knowledge Factor and the Possession Factor.** ✅

C) The Knowledge Factor and the Inherence Factor.

D) The Knowledge Factor and the **[[Hardware Token]]**.
