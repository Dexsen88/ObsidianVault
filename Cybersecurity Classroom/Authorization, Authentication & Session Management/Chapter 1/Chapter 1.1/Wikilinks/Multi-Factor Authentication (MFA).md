### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🛡️**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security control that requires a user to successfully present evidence from **two or more** independent authentication factors to verify their identity.

- **Goal:** To mitigate the risk of a single factor being compromised. If an attacker steals a password (Knowledge Factor), they still cannot gain access without the user's phone or **[[Hardware Token]]** (Possession Factor).
    
- **Security Benefit:** MFA significantly raises the difficulty for an attacker, acting as a mandatory layer of **[[Defense in Depth]]** for authentication. This is crucial for protecting the **[[Confidentiality]]** of user accounts and data.
    
- **Factors:** MFA relies on combining at least two of the three factors: Something You Know (e.g., password), Something You Have (e.g., app code), or Something You Are (e.g., fingerprint).
