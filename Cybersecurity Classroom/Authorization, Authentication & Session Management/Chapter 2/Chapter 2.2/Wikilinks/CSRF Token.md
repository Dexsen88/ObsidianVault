### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 🛡️**

A **CSRF Token** (Anti-CSRF Token) is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value generated by the server and included in all state-changing forms and API requests. The server verifies this token upon submission.

- **Goal:** To definitively prevent **[[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]]**.
    
- **Mechanism:** Since the malicious external site cannot read the secret token (due to the **Same-Origin Policy**), it cannot include the required token in the forged request. When the server receives the forged request without the valid token, the request is rejected.
    
- **Integration:** The token is usually stored securely in the **[[Session Store]]** and then embedded as a hidden field in an HTML form or a header in an API request. This must be implemented alongside the **SameSite** cookie attribute as part of a **[[Defense in Depth]]** strategy.
