### 🧠 **Definition and Mechanism 👤**

**Authentication** is the process of verifying a claimed identity. It answers the question: **"Who are you?"**

- **Goal:** To confirm that a user or system process is who they claim to be, typically by requiring them to present credentials.
    
- **Factors:** Strong authentication requires using **[[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)]]**—combining at least two of the three factors: Something You Know (e.g., password), Something You Have (e.g., token), or Something You Are (e.g., biometric).
    
- **Process:** Upon successful verification, the system creates a **[[Session Token]]** to maintain the user's state. Authentication is the mandatory first step before **[[Authorization]]** can occur.
